        Get all OCR words on a given page.

        There are two possible settings, `snapped=False` returns the original word boxes as
        returned by the OCR predictions, while `snapped=True` performs additional heuristics to
        make the bounding boxes tight around text. This is used in evaluation to make sure correct
        predictions are not penalized if they differ from ground-truth only by the amount of
        background on any side of the bounding box.

        Parameters
        ----------
        page
            Page number (0-based) for which to get all OCR words.
        snapped
            If False, use original detections. If True, use boundign boxes snapped to the text.
        use_cached_snapping
            Only used if `snapped=True`. If True, the OCR cache (including the files on disk) is
            used to load/store the snapped bounding boxes.
        get_page_image
            Only used if `snapped=True`. Not needed if `use_cached_snapping=True` and the snapped
            bounding boxes are pre-computed. This should be a function that returns the image of
            the page. It is needed to perform the snapping. Tip: make sure the image is stored in
            memory. E.g., use `lambda page_img=page_img: page_img` or open the document first
            (`with document:`) to turn on memory caching and then use
            `functools.partial(document.page_image, page)`.

    """
    Locate text inside of an array representing which pixels are in the foreground.

    The location is initialized as a bbox covering the whole array and then shranked in two phases:
    * In the first phase, more aggressive shrinking is done around the margins. In this phase the
      bbox is shranked by at most `margin_size` in each direction.
    * In the second phase, shrinking can proceed without limits but is less aggressive.

    If at any point the bbox would be shranked to an empty bbox, `None` is returned.

    Shrinking is controlled by two parameters for each phase (`min_char_width_*` and
    `min_line_height_*`). They define how many consecutive non-empty columns/rows are needed to
    stop further shrinking.

    Motivation:
    The implementation and parameters are fine-tuned to the pre-computed OCR provided with the
    DocILE dataset, which in practice is not tight on the text and often contains some visual
    elements around the margins of the detected text box (such as table borders or small portions
    of the surrounding text).

    Failure scenarios:
    The shrinking can be overly aggressive in the cases when very low or narrow character (such as
    'i', 'l', ':', ',', '.') is very close to the margins or when punctuation can be separated from
    the rest of the letters (such as in word 'mini'). This is not a problem for the purposes of
    DocILE evaluation where the Pseudo-Character Centers will be shifted only marginally in these
    cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    foreground_mask
        Two dimensional numpy array containing booleans, representing which pixels are part of the
        foreground.
    margin_size
        Shrink the bounding box aggressively in the margins of the bounding box.
    min_char_width_margin
        Number of consecutive non-empty (i.e., containing at least one foreground pixel) columns
        needed to not shrink past the current column. This applies to the first and last
        `margin_size` columns.
    min_line_height_margin
        Number of consecutive non-empty rows needed to not shrink past the current row. This
        applies to the first and last `margin_size` rows.
    min_char_width_inside
        As `min_char_width_margin` but applies to columns that are further than `margin_size` from
        the edges.
    min_line_height_inside
        As `min_line_height_margin` but applies to rows that are further than `margin_size` from
        the edges.
